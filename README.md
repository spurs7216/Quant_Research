## üìäSimple
Perform a deep dive into crypto return dynamics and test a simple mean-reversion strategy.
1. **Momentum & Volatility Factors**  
   - **Momentum (L = 24 h)**: cumulative return over the past 24 hours  
   - **Volatility (L = 24 h)**: rolling standard deviation of hourly returns  
   - Tag top/bottom coins each period and evaluate next‚Äêhour return  

2. **Autoregressive Modeling**  
   - Fit **AR(p)** models to each coin‚Äôs return series  
   - Inspect coefficients and residuals for serial correlation  

3. **Stationarity & Mean-Reversion Tests**  
   - **Augmented Dickey‚ÄìFuller (ADF)** to confirm stationarity of returns  
   - Estimate **half-life** of mean reversion via AR(1) decay  
   - Demonstrate stronger mean-reverting behavior in certain coins  

4. **Cointegration Analysis**  
   - **Cointegration tests** between coin pairs/triples  
     - **CADF** (Christiano‚ÄìDickey‚ÄìFuller)  
     - **Johansen‚Äôs test** for multivariate cointegration  
   - Identify candidate pairs that share long-run equilibrium  

5. **Pairs-Trading / Mean-Reversion Strategy**  
   - Construct **spread** \(S‚Çú = price‚ÇÅ‚Çú ‚Äì Œ≤¬∑price‚ÇÇ‚Çú\) using OLS‚Äêestimated Œ≤  
   - Backtest a simple rule:  
     - Go **long** spread when it is sufficiently below its rolling mean  
     - Go **short** when above its rolling mean  
   - Evaluate P&L, Sharpe ratio, and turnover  

## üìäMachine learning strategy
Experiment with a range of supervised and unsupervised learning methods ‚Äî plus a reinforcement‚Äêlearning agent ‚Äî to generate trading signals and build a crypto portfolio.
1. **Supervised Classification Models**  
   - **Logistic Regression (L1)** with cross‚Äêvalidated regularization strength.  
   - **Random Forest** for capturing nonlinear interactions among features.  
   - **LassoCV** as a built‚Äêin feature‚Äêselecting linear model.  
   - **XGBoost & CatBoost**: gradient‚Äêboosted tree ensembles, grid‚Äêsearched over depth, learning rate, iterations.  
   - **Signal construction**:  
     - Classifier probability > 0.5 ‚Üí go **long**, < 0.5 ‚Üí go **short**.  
     - Compute **Sharpe ratio** on validation/test using `compute_sharpe_from_signal()`.  
   - **Model selection** picks hyperparameters that maximize out‚Äêof‚Äêsample Sharpe.

2. **Unsupervised Feature Learning (Autoencoders)**  
   - **Seq-to-Seq Autoencoder**: compress rolling‚Äêwindow returns into a low-dimensional latent space.  
   - **Denoising Autoencoder**: train to reconstruct original returns from noisy inputs, yielding robust embeddings.  
   - **Use case**: append encoded features to the supervised models to improve generalization.

3. **Reinforcement Learning Agent**  
   - **Environment**: `CryptoPortfolioEnv` simulates a small portfolio with transaction costs and slippage.  
   - **Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) for stable policy updates.  
   - **Workflow**:  
     1. Collect rollouts in training environment  
     2. Update policy/value networks  
     3. Backtest final policy on held‚Äêout data  

## üìäHidden Markov Model
Leverage HMMs to identify latent market regimes and drive a simple regime‚Äêaware portfolio.
1. **Training the HMM**  
   - Fit a **Gaussian HMM** with \(K\) hidden states (e.g. \(K=2\) or \(3\)) to the multivariate return+feature series.  
   - Use the **Baum‚ÄìWelch** algorithm to estimate transition probabilities and per-state emission parameters.  
   - Inspect the fitted means and variances in each state to interpret regimes (e.g. ‚Äúlow-vol mean-reversion‚Äù vs. ‚Äúhigh-vol trending‚Äù).

2. **Regime Decoding & Probabilities**  
   - Apply the **Viterbi algorithm** to assign the most likely state sequence to the historical data.  
   - Compute **smoothed state-posterior probabilities** for each minute, giving a soft view of regime membership.

3. **Regime‚ÄêBased Trading Rules**  
   - Define a **long/short rule** for each regime, for example:  
     - **Regime 0 (Mean‚Äêreverting):** Go **long** when posterior > 0.8, flat otherwise.  
     - **Regime 1 (Trending):** Use a simple momentum signal (e.g. 1‚Äêhour moving average crossover).  
   - Optionally, tailor **position sizing** by regime volatility (e.g. smaller positions in high-vol states).
